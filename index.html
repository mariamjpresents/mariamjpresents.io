        Hello, Samir Jawhar. Odd, isn't it, that a website knows your full name? Worry not. This is not a case of malware. It is a gift from your daughter!!!! I made a website for you!!!
        This is my way of demonstrating that I appreciate you and everything that you do for me, even when it appears that I have forgotten you or have grown distant from you. As stated
        in the title, this is my present to you, a project on which I have worked hard, because I wanted to dedicate something special to you.
