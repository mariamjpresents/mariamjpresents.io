        Hello, Samir Jawhar. Odd, isn't it, that a website knows your full name? Worry not. This is not a case of malware. It is a gift from your daughter!!!! I made a website for you!!!
        This is my way of demonstrating that I appreciate you and everything that you do for me, even when it appears that I have forgotten you or have grown distant from you. As stated
        in the title, this is my present to you, a project on which I have worked hard, because I wanted to dedicate something special to you.

           As for stylistic choices, I picked the color yellow for the header background and "submit" button because I know that it is your favorite color. I also chose a cursive font for
           the title because your handwriting is cursive. Finally, I inserted horizontal lines at the end of each segment because I believe you harbor a preference for this style.
           <br>
           <br>
           It is admittedly simple, perhaps even bland, but I hope you like it.
